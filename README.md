# Barber-shop
This is a static webpage.
I have created the Barber shop website in which anyone can see the main highlight of our shop and check the services available in the shop
they can find the working hours and contact deatials to book the slot online.
I have used HTML, CSS, AZURE STATIC WEB APP, AZURE STORAGE ACCOUNT .
I hosted the webpage using  STATIC WEB APP service and used the STORAGE ACCOUNT for uploding my code to azure.
